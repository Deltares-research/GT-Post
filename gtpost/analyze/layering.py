    """
    Get preservation potential of each deposit in the final model. i.e. when a deposit
    is (partially) preserved it returns the thickness of the final preserved sediment
    layer. If the layer is not preserved, it returns 0 for the given timestep and
    location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zcor : np.ndarray
        z-coordinates (depth at each timestep)
    subsidence : np.ndarray
        Array with cumulative subsidence per timestep

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Preservation status array: 0 = deposit will disappear later on due to erosion.
        any other positive value indicates the thickness of the preserved layer that
        formed during the given timestep.
